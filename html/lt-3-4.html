    <p>Jerusalem: Israel's ministry of health said Wednesday it had recorded two cases of new Covid variant, but which officials said they were not unduly worried about.<br>
        The strain, combining two sub-variants of the Omicron version of the Covid-19 virus -- dubbed BA.1 and BA.2 -- was recorded during PCR tests on two passengers arriving at Israel's Ben Gurion airport.<br>
        
        "This variant is still unknown around the world," the ministry statement read.<br>
        
        "The two cases of the combined strain, which have been discovered so far, suffered from mild symptoms of fever, headaches and muscle dystrophy, and do not require a special medical response," it added.<br>
        
        Israel's pandemic response chief, Salman Zarka, played down the risks.<br>

        "The phenomenon of combined variants is well known," Zarka told Army Radio. "At this stage, we are not worried about it leading to serious cases".<br>

        More than four million people out of Israel's population of 9.2 million have received three coronavirus vaccine shots.</p>
